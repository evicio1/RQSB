# Blazor FIRE Calculators
These FIRE calculators were created by [Bradley Wells](https://wellsb.com/) using Blazor, a .NET technology that allows you to build dynamic web applications using C# instead of JavaScript.

## Is there a demo?
**Yes!** You can try out the client-side Blazor Fire Calculators at [https://fire.wellsb.com/](https://fire.wellsb.com/).  This is a Blazor WebAssembly app, so all processing is done using client resources.  Feedback is welcome!

## What is FIRE?
**FIRE** stands for **F**inancial **I**ndependence, **R**etire **E**arly.  Financial independence means you no longer have to work for a living.  When you have enough income (from investments, real estate, passive business, etc) to pay for your living expenses for the rest of your life, you are financially independent.

### How do I become Financially Independent?
- Spend Less
- Save More
- Earn More

### When will I be FI?
An important part of the path toward FI is to save as much money as you can, and let that money work for you.  Passive index fund investing is a great way to get more out of the money you save.  A widely accepted rule of thumb is known as the 4% rule or **Safe Withdrawal Rate** (SWR).  When you have enough saved that you can withdraw and live off of 4% (or less) of your total investments each year, you may be financially independent.  In general, if you follow the SWR principle, you can expect your portfolio to grow by a faster rate than the amount you withdraw each year.
